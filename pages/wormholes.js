    Movement is achieved by stating every position an object is moved to. This means that the program is responsible in some fashion for providing a list of positions and delivering them at a certain rate to achieve velocity or movement along a path. To get the speed I wanted I needed to add 20px every computational cycle which is dictated by the requestAnimationFrame() method, which isnâ€™t all that smooth.

    This is an experimentation with animating SVG gradients in React.
    I originally conceived the idea during the Global Game Jam 2017. The theme
    was waves. I wanted to <em>make</em> a visual/audio interface that created an experience
    with wave like forms.

    I chose to use React and was suprised to disover that I was able to implement SMIL animations.
    And contrary to the deprecation warnings I could implement it on different browsers; doubtfull
    that it would work on IE any version, because it was Microsoft that killed the technology by
    saying IE would never implement SMIL. Oh well.
